name: process-code-coverage-summary
description: GitHub Action that can create a status check or PR comment based on the provided results summary file.

inputs:
  github-token:
    description: 'Token used to interact with the repository. Generally `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN.`'
    required: true
  summary-file:
    description: 'The summary file generated by the report-generator action.'
    required: true
  report-name:
    description: 'The desired name of the report that is shown on the PR Comment and inside the Status Check.'
    required: true
    default: Code Coverage Results
  create-status-check:
    description: 'Flag indicating whether a status check with code coverage results should be generated.'
    required: true
    default: 'true'
  check-name:
    description: |
      The desired name of the status check.
      *Only applicable when `create-status-check` is true.*
    required: true
    default: code coverage
  create-pr-comment:
    description: 'Flag indicating whether a PR comment with code coverage results should be generated.  When `true` the default behavior is to update an existing comment if one exists.'
    required: true
    default: 'true'
  update-comment-if-one-exists:
    description: |
      This flag determines whether a new comment is created or if the action updates an existing comment (*if one is found*).
      *Only applicable when `create-pr-comment` is true.*
    required: true
    default: 'true'
  update-comment-key:
    description: |
      A unique identifier which will be added to the generated markdown as a comment (*it will not be visible in the PR comment*).
      This identifier enables creating then updating separate results comments on the PR if more than one instance of this action is included in a single job.
      This can be helpful when there are multiple coverage projects that run separately but are part of the same job.
      Each instance of the action should have a different key and this value should be static so it remains the same each time the workflow is run.
      Defaults to GITHUB_JOB_GITHUB_ACTION if not provided.
      *Only applicable when `create-pr-comment` and `update-comment-if-one-exists` are `true`.*
    required: false
  ignore-threshold-failures:
    description: |
      If the coverage falls below the threshold and this is set to `true` the status check's conclusion will be set to `neutral`
      and the `coverage-outcome` output will be set to `Passed`.
      This is useful if you want coverage reported but do not want a failing status check to block pull requests.
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  line-threshold:
    description: |
      Minimum threshold for line coverage. 
      The status check conclusion will be `failure `and `coverage-outcome` will be `Failed` if the actual coverage amount is less than this.
      Set to `0` to disable line coverage checks. When `0`, the status check will always be `neutral` and the `coverage-outcome` will be `Passed`.
    required: false
    default: '0'
  branch-threshold:
    description: |
      Minimum threshold for branch coverage.
      The status check conclusion will be `failure `and `coverage-outcome` will be `Failed` if the actual coverage amount is less than this.
      Set to 0 if you do not want thresholds to be applied.
    required: false
    default: '0'

outputs:
  coverage-outcome:
    description: 'Coverage outcome based on Threshold comparisons: Failed|Passed.  If exceptions are thrown or if it exits early because of argument errors, this is set to Failed.'
  coverage-results-truncated:
    description: 'Flag indicating whether coverage results were truncated due to markdown exceeding character limit of 65535.'
  coverage-results-file-path:
    description: 'File path for the file that contains the coverage results in markdown format.  This is the same output that is posted in the PR comment.'
  status-check-id:
    description: 'The ID of the Status Check that was created.  This is only set if `create-status-check` is `true` and a status check was created successfully.'
  pr-comment-id:
    description: 'The ID of the PR comment that was created.  This is only set if `create-pr-comment` is `true` and a PR was created successfully.'
